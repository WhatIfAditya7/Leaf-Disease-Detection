# Leaf-Disease-Detection <br>
In this project we will identify the disease affecting the crop, taking in consideration the people not aware of the type of disease. <br>

# Problem Statement <br>
Crop wastage due to diseases is largely unfurled around the globe. If such a mass quantity of crop sets is squandered it might be a difficult task to encounter. Food security is an initiative that we all have to take to maintain a healthy and wealthy environment. <br>

# Solution <br>
For the backend, we have used Machine learning and Artificial Neural Network to train the images. Image pre-processing, data reduction, segmentation, and recognition are the processes used in managing images with ANN. An image can be represented as a matrix, each element of the matrix containing color information for a pixel. The matrix is used as input data into the neuronal network. The small dimensions of the images, easily and quickly help to learn and establish the size of the vector and the number of input vectors. The transfer function used is sigmoidal. The learning rate includes values between [0,1] and the error is recommended to be below 0.1. <br>
